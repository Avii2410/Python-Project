# Python-Project
# Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis
Conducted in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) datasets to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

Filtered EVs based on budget and range criteria, grouped data by manufacturer, and calculated average battery capacities to identify product trends.

Visualized relationships between battery capacity and driving range, detecting outliers in energy consumption and highlighting efficiency variances.

Developed a Python-based EV recommendation system that suggests optimal vehicles based on user inputs for budget, desired range, and battery capacity.

Applied hypothesis testing to compare engine power between Tesla and Audi vehicles, generating insights that informed strategic comparisons and positioning.

Delivered actionable recommendations to guide consumers and stakeholders in selecting EV models aligned with performance and cost expectations.
